As a structural design pattern, Decorator allows the 
developers **add new behaviors to objects in execution time**. 
It's done by the usage of a wrapper that contains the new 
behaviors.

# This Implementation

This implementation emulates a simple notification library 
which lets a device notify its user about an event (New messages,
payments, alerts, etc.).

The current solution is based on the 
[refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/) 
post, where Decorator pattern is explained:
